## Introduction
In this report we will address more specifically software [model 4+1 architecture model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%2B1_architectural_view_model), by putting 4 diagrams and a further interpretation. **Logical view** that provides information about the program functionality, **Implementation view** ilustrates the package diagram. **Process view** explains the system processes and how they communicate, and focuses on the runtime behavior of the system,**Deployment view** shows the system hardware and how software components are distributed across the hardware.
